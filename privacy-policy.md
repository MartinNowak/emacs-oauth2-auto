## Privacy policy

In short: `emacs-oauth2-auto` only stores the authentication token in your local
machine, and does not transmit it.

`emacs-oauth2-auto` itself does not access or store any sensitive user data,
other than the OAuth token required for authentication. In particular, it does
not store the username or password, or any email or calendar events from the
user.

The authentication token fetched by `emacs-oauth2-auto` may then be used by
other software in the user's computer, mainly (but not exclusively) in their
Emacs installation. What the user does with their own token is the user's
responsibility.
